<p><h3>The D700</h3> has image quality indistinguishable from the klunky old D3, both in terms of sharpness and at high ISOs.
The D700 wins for just about everything, especially action and taking pictures of your friends, family and kids. The D700 has superior autofocus performance over the Canon 5D Mark II.
The Nikon D700 is Nikon’s first affordable full-frame (FX) camera, with 12 megapixels and amazing low light performance. I have been shooting with the Nikon D700 for the past three years,
 and I’m not sure why it took me so long to write a review of my favorite camera… I guess I focused so much on testing new lenses.
 So, what makes the D700 the best camera for me? In summary, it is the excellent image quality and high ISO performance, superb autofocus, large viewfinder, great ergonomics, weather-sealing,
 good speed, the not-too-bulky size and much more…a long list of good reasons at half the price of top-of-the-line professional cameras like Nikon D3s. Let’s take a look at these in more detail.
