		About a little guy that lives in a blue world</h2>
	<p>And all day and all night and everything he sees Is just blue
		Like him inside and outside
		Blue his house with a blue little window
		And a blue Corvette
		And everything is blue for him
		And himself and everybody around
		'Cause he ain't got nobody to listen
		I'm Blue da ba dee da ba daa
		Da ba dee da ba daa, da ba dee da ba daa, da ba dee da ba daa
		Da ba dee da ba daa, da ba dee da ba daa, da ba dee da ba daa</p>
